# A 2D Side-Scrolling Runner Game in Raylib

Dapper Dasher is a lightweight side-scrolling runner game built in C++ using the Raylib graphics library. In this game, you control **Scarfy**, a cartoon character who runs automatically and must jump over incoming **nebula** obstacles to survive. The game ends with either a **win** if all obstacles are passed, or a **game over** if Scarfy collides with one.
